# Short description about the project

I used simple design that I created with the Bootstrpa & som custom styles. Application is also responsive for all platforms.
Due to lack of time, I focused on the main functionality of the main task.
If I had more time, I would improve the search input, fix the loading of images from invalid url addresses.
I would use google maps to display hotels on the map.
To display events nearby, I would use hotel coordinates and events that I would recalculate at a distance.
